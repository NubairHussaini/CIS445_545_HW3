        <h3>Values And Beliefs:</h3>
        Your values are the things that you believe are important in the way you live and work.
        They should determine your priorities, and, deep down, they're probably the measures you use to tell if your life is turning out the way you want it to.
        When the things that you do and the way you behave match your values, life is usually good which means you're satisfied and content. But when these don't align with your personal values, that's when things feel wrong. This can be a real source of unhappiness.
        This is why making a conscious effort to identify your values is so important and i believe on working on it.
